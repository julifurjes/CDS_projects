# Investigating the Relationship between Crime Rates and Estate Pricing in West Yorkshire

## About the assignment

Various studies have been investigating the relationship between crime rates and housing prices. The findings of these studies suggest a significant relationship between crime rates and estate prices. High crime rates tend to impact housing prices, leading to decreased property values negatively. A neighbourhood's perceived safety and security play a crucial role in housing market dynamics. Areas with high crime rates often develop a negative reputation, deterring potential buyers or renters. Consequently, reduced demand for housing in these neighbourhoods can result in lower prices.
